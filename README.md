# KULTRA-MEGA-STORES-Inventory-SQL-Analysis
## DESCRIPTION
This project analyzes an e-commerce product dataset to uncover insights about pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer engagement. The goal is to clean the data, explore patterns using PivotTables, and present findings in a dynamic Excel dashboard.

## Project Topic:Ecommerce product dataset

## Project Overview
This project uses SQL to extract actionable insights from an e-commerce dataset, addressing key business questions such as:
- Identifying top-performing product categories and regions
- Understanding customer behavior and segmentation
- Evaluating shipping cost efficiency
- Recommending strategies to boost revenue
  
The analysis is structured around two core business case scenarios, each designed to support strategic decision-making through data-driven insights. The goal is to empower stakeholders with clear, evidence-based recommendations that can enhance performance across marketing, logistics, and sales operations.


## DATA SOURCES
The dataset used in this project is a simulated e-commerce dataset containing product details, pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and review counts. It Aopen source data that camn be downloaded for educational and analytical purposes to demonstrate data cleaning, SQL querying, and dashboard development.



# Data Cleaning (SQL & Excel)
Tasks Performed:
-	Removed duplicate records
-	Handled missing values in rating, price, and discount_percentage
- Converted percentage strings to numeric values
-	Standardized column names and formats for consistency
  
## Tools Used:
-	SQL for initial data filtering and transformation
-	Excel for final formatting, validation, and cleanup

üìÅ Files

    SQL Dsa Project Query.sql: Main SQL query file

    KMS_File.csv (assumed): Raw dataset

    README.md: Project documentation

üì¶ Dataset

Table Name: KMS_File
Additional Table: Order_Status (for return status)
Imported from a CSV file into a relational database.
‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

Before analysis, the following columns were formatted to two decimal places:

    Sales, Discount, Profit, Unit_Price, Shipping_Cost, Product_Base_Margin

ALTER TABLE KMS_File
ALTER COLUMN Sales DECIMAL(10,2);
-- Repeated for other relevant columns

üìä Case Scenario 1: Sales & Revenue Optimization

1Ô∏è‚É£ Which product category had the highest sales?

SELECT TOP 1 Product_Category, SUM(Sales) AS Highest_Sales
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Product_Category
ORDER BY Highest_Sales DESC;

2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the top 3 and bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?

    Top 3 Regions

SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS Profitable_Region
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Profitable_Region DESC;

    Bottom 3 Regions

SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS Profitable_Region
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Profitable_Region ASC;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total sales of appliances in Ontario?

SELECT SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_File
WHERE Province = 'Ontario' AND Product_Sub_Category = 'Appliances';

4Ô∏è‚É£ How to increase revenue from bottom 10 customers?

SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Name, SUM(Unit_Price * Order_Quantity * (1 - Discount)) AS Total_Revenue
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;

üìå Recommended Strategies:

    Personalized discounts

    Customer engagement via email/SMS/phone

    Product up-selling and bundling

    Win-back campaigns

5Ô∏è‚É£ Which shipping method incurred the highest shipping cost?

SELECT TOP 1 Ship_Mode, SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Ship_MCost
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Total_Ship_MCost DESC;

üìä Case Scenario 2: Customer & Operational Insights

6Ô∏è‚É£ Most valuable customers and their purchases?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Segment, Product_Sub_Category,
       SUM(Unit_Price * Order_Quantity * (1 - Discount)) AS Total_Revenue
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Customer_Segment, Product_Sub_Category
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;

7Ô∏è‚É£ Highest sales among small business customers?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, SUM(Sales) AS Highest_Sales
FROM KMS_File
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Highest_Sales DESC;

8Ô∏è‚É£ Corporate customer with most orders (2009‚Äì2012)?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM KMS_File
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Corporate'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC;

9Ô∏è‚É£ Most profitable consumer customer?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, SUM(Sales) AS Most_Profitable_Customer
FROM KMS_File
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Most_Profitable_Customer DESC;

üîü Which customers returned items?

SELECT K.Customer_Name, K.Order_ID, K.Customer_Segment
FROM KMS_File K
JOIN Order_Status O ON K.Order_ID = O.Order_ID
WHERE O.Status = 'Returned';

üöö Shipping Cost vs Order Priority Does shipping cost align with order priority?

SELECT Order_Priority, Ship_Mode,
       COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_Count,
       AVG(Shipping_Cost) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM KMS_File
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Avg_Shipping_Cost DESC;

üìå Insight: Shipping resources were not efficiently allocated based on urgency. Some low-priority orders incurred higher shipping costs than high-priority ones

‚úÖ Conclusion This project offers insights for:

    Targeted customer engagement

    Region-wise and category-wise marketing

    Shipping and logistics optimization

    High-value customer retention
